# twitter-mcp-agent
An MCP Agent that links to your Twitter / X.com account that uses Twitterâ€™s API to retrieve and analyze engagement metrics (likes, retweets, replies, impressions, etc.) from my own account. The purpose is to identify trends in my posting behavior and optimize future content by understanding which types of tweets perform best over time.
